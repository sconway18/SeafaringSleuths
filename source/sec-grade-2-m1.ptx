        <p> The following Common Core Standards are touched as learners work through
        this first Seafaring Sleuth's story.
        <ul>
            <li><c>CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.2.0A.B.2</c>: add and subtract within 20</li>
            <li><c>CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.2.0A.C.4</c>: use addition to find the total 
                number of objects arranged in a rectangular array</li>

    <subsection><title>A Life at Sea</title>
        <introduction>In Seabrook, a small town by the sea, three best friends named 
        Lily, Max, and Mia wander the beach. They loved to explore the sands at 
        the edge of the ocean, looking for seashells and watching the waves crash 
        against the shore. Hopscotch, Lily's rooster followed closely behind, 
        pecking in the grass and sand, snacking on some bugs. On this sunny 
        afternoon, as they were playing by the water's edge, Max noticed something 
        strange washed up on the sand.
        </introduction>
    
        <p>It was a rusty old submarine, covered in seaweed and barnacles. 
            The friends were amazed! They had never seen a real submarine 
            before. As they got closer, they saw a note attached to the 
            submarine's hatch. It read: <i>"To the brave adventurers who find 
            this, the seas await your curiosity. Come aboard and set sail!"</i>
        </p>
    
        <p>Lily, Max, and Mia looked at each other with excitement. They had 
            always dreamed of going on a real adventure, and here was their 
            chance! With a sense of anticipation, they climbed aboard the 
            submarine.
        </p>

        <p>Inside, they found the submarine's control room. It was filled with 
            all sorts of buttons, levers, and screens. But to their surprise, 
            everything seemed kid-friendly and easy to understand. It was as if 
            the submarine was meant for them to explore!
        </p>

        <p>As they looked around, they noticed something else peculiar. The 
            submarine had a small library filled with books about math and science. 
            There were books about numbers and operations, geometry and navigation 
            at sea, and even marine biology. It was as if the submarine was inviting 
            them to learn and discover new things.
        </p>

        <p>As they continued to explore, Mia noticed a large chair surrounded by 
            important-looking electronics. There were several raised video screens 
            and hundreds of buttons on the control panel in front of the chair. In 
            all her excitement, as she called out to Lily and Max, she tripped on the 
            base of the chair, falling backwards towards the control panel. Mia's hand 
            fell onto the biggest, shinyest, red button on the panel as she caught 
            herself. One of the raised screens began to light up.
        </p> 
        
        <p>The three friends looked intently at the screen, as the words began to 
            come into focus. As they waited, a voice came over the speakers hidden 
            in the coners of the navigation room, <i>"Hello Seafaring Sleuths. Welcome 
            aboard the SS Curiosity!"</i> The words on the screen could be read now, 
            they appear in the box below.

        </exercise>

        <p>Having used the control panel to type in the answer, Lily, Max, and Mia 
            began to hear a loud <i>whoosh</i> and then a lot of splashing outside. 
            They felt the submarine begin to rise. A new question appeared on the 
            captain's screen.

        </exercise>

        <p>With that answer typed in, the friends braced themselves as the submarine 
            began to move. The SS Curiosity began to glide out to sea, Lily, Max, and 
            Mia (along with their loyal friend, Hopscotch the rooster) looked at each 
            other with wide eyes. They didn't know where they were headed, but one thing 
            was for sure -- they were embarking on the adventure of a lifetime!

    <subsection><title>Recapping What we Read</title>
    
        <introduction>As we follow the adventures of the Seafaring Sleuths, 
            readers will answer math and science questions to progress through 
            the stories, find and access treasures, and solve other mysteries at 
            sea. As important as the math and science content is, it is also 
            important to ensure that the reader comprehends what they've read and 
            can explain back the important components of each story. Because of this,
            each section/story will end with a set of reading comprehension and 
            critical thinking questions.
