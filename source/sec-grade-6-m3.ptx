  <subsection><title>Common Core Standards Touched</title>
    <p> The following Common Core Standards are touched as learners work through
      this Seafaring Sleuth's story.
      <ul>
          <li><c>CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.6.RP.A.3.A </c> Make tables of equivalent ratios relating 
            quantities with whole-number measurements, find missing values in the tables, 
            and plot the pairs of values on the coordinate plane. Use tables to compare ratios. </li>

    </ul>

      <p>As the SS Curiosity glided further into the deep ocean, the friends marveled at 
        the fascinating marine life around them. Suddenly, the submarine came to a gentle stop. 
        The screen lit up again, and the friendly voice spoke, "To continue your journey, you 
        must solve the next challenge. Use your math skills to navigate successfully." </p>
     
       <p>A new screen appeared, displaying a complex-looking underwater puzzle. </p>
       
       
         <exercise exercise-customization="inline" exercise-interactive="static"><title>A Random Problem</title><introduction>
     
     
         </introduction><myopenmath problem="1391739" />
       </exercise>
       
       
       <p>They typed the completed table into the control panel. The screen flashed a bright green, indicating their 
        answers were correct. Another question appeared. </p>
       
         <exercise exercise-customization="inline" exercise-interactive="static"><title>A Random Problem</title><introduction>

       </exercise>
       
       
      <p>Lily stated, "We can use this graph to predict future values. It's like a map guiding us forward." </p>
     
       <p> The control panel beeped and displayed a new message, "Great job, Seafaring Sleuths! You have successfully 
        navigated this part of your journey. Prepare for the next adventure!"  </p>
       
      <p>The submarine started moving again, smoothly and confidently. The friends knew they were getting better at 
        solving the challenges and felt ready for whatever came next. </p>

       <p> The screen went dark, and the friends took a moment to relax. They knew more adventures and puzzles awaited 
        them, but with teamwork and a little math, they felt prepared for anything. </p>
