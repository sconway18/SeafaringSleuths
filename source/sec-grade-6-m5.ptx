      <p>The SS Curiosity moved deeper into the mysterious ocean, approaching the heart of the Sunken City. 
        The ancient ruins were covered in glowing algae, casting an eerie but beautiful light. As the submarine 
        approached, the screen lit up once again. </p>

        <p>The friendly voice spoke, "Welcome back, Seafaring Sleuths. To uncover the secrets of the Sunken City, 
            you must solve these challenges. Good luck!" </p>

        slowly opened, revealing ancient gold and gems.  </p>

        <p>"Excellent work, Seafaring Sleuths!" the voice said. "You have uncovered the secrets of the Sunken City. 
            Prepare for the next adventure!" </p>

            friends felt a sense of accomplishment and excitement. They knew more challenges awaited them, but 
            they were confident that with their combined skills and a bit of math, they could overcome any obstacle. </p>
