    <subsection><title>Adventure Begins</title>
        <p> In Seabrook, a small town by the sea, three best friends named Lily, 
            Max, and Mia loved to play on the beach. They liked to look for 
            seashells and watch the waves. Lily's pet rooster, Hopscotch, always 
            followed them, pecking in the sand.
        </p>

        <p> One sunny day, Max saw something strange on the sand. It was an old 
            submarine, covered in seaweed and barnacles. The friends were amazed! 
            They had never seen a real submarine before. They found a note on the 
            submarine. It said, "To the brave adventurers who find this, the seas 
            need your help. Come aboard and set sail!"
        </p>

        <p> Lily, Max, and Mia were so excited. They climbed into the submarine. 
            Inside, they saw many buttons, levers, and screens. Everything looked 
            easy to use, as if it was made for kids. They also found a small library 
            with books about math and science. It seemed like the submarine wanted 
            them to learn new things.
        </p>

        <p> Mia saw a big chair with lots of buttons around it. She was so excited 
            that she tripped and fell. Her hand hit the biggest, shiniest, red button. 
            A screen lit up. The friends looked at the screen, and a voice said, "Hello 
            Seafaring Sleuths. Welcome aboard the SS Curiosity!" A question was on the 
            screen.

        <p> They typed the answers into the control panel. They heard a loud whoosh and 
            felt the submarine rise. A new question appeared on the screen.

        <p>They typed in the answer and felt the submarine start to move. The SS 
            Curiosity began to glide out to sea. Lily, Max, and Mia, along with Hopscotch, looked at each other with wide 
            eyes. They didn't know where they were going, but they knew it would be an 
            adventure!

    <subsection><title>Recapping What we Read</title>
    
        <introduction>As we follow the adventures of the Seafaring Sleuths, 
            readers will answer math and science questions to progress through 
            the stories, find and access treasures, and solve other mysteries at 
            sea. As important as the math and science content is, it is also 
            important to ensure that the reader comprehends what they've read and 
            can explain back the important components of each story. Because of this,
            each section/story will end with a set of reading comprehension and 
            critical thinking questions.
