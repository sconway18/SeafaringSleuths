<p>1.1.2 Adventure Begins </p>

<p> In Seabrook, a small town by the sea, three best friends named Lily, 
  Max, and Mia loved to play on the beach. They liked to look for seashells 
  and watch the waves. Lily’s pet rooster, Hopscotch, always followed them, 
  pecking in the sand. </p>

 <p>One sunny day, Max saw something strange on the sand. It was an old 
  submarine, covered in seaweed and barnacles. The friends were amazed! 
  They had never seen a real submarine before. They found a note on the 
  submarine. It said, "To the brave adventurers who find this, the seas 
  need your help. Come aboard and set sail!" </p>
  
   <p>Lily, Max, and Mia were so excited. They climbed into the submarine. 
    Inside, they saw many buttons, levers, and screens. Everything looked 
    easy to use, as if it was made for kids. They also found a small library 
    with books about math and science. It seemed like the submarine wanted 
    them to learn new things. </p>
  
   <p> Mia saw a big chair with lots of buttons around it. She was so excited 
    that she tripped and fell. Her hand hit the biggest, shiniest, red button. 
    A screen lit up. The friends looked at the screen, and a voice said, "Hello 
    Seafaring Sleuths. Welcome aboard the SS Curiosity!" A question was on the 
    screen. </p>

  <p>They typed the answers into the control panel. They heard a loud whoosh and 
    felt the submarine rise. A new question appeared on the screen. </p>

 <p>They typed in the answer and felt the submarine start to move. The SS Curiosity 
  began to glide out to sea. Lily, Max, and Mia, along with Hopscotch, looked at each 
  other with wide eyes. They didn’t know where they were going, but they knew it 
  would be an adventure! </p>
