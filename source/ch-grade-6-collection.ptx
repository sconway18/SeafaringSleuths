  <title>Seafaring Sleuths for Sixth Grade</title>

  <introduction>
    <p> This chapter contains the misadventures of the Seafaring Sleuths at a 
      sixth grade level. This means that the reading level is targeted at 
      sixth grade students, the mathematics and science topics encountered 
      are also at a sixth grade level. Each section begins with Common Core 
      standards covered by the reading, comprehension, mathematics, and science 
      topics that learners will encounter through that section's mystery. </p>
    <p> We hope that you, and your students, enjoy these stories as much as we 
      enjoy creating them!</p>
