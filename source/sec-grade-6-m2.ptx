<subsection><title>The First Challenge</title>

 <p>The SS Curiosity glided smoothly beneath the waves. Through the portholes, 
  Lily, Max, and Mia could see schools of colorful fish swimming by. Hopscotch 
  clucked nervously but stayed close to Lily. </p>

  <p>The screen in front of them lit up again, and the friendly voice spoke, 
    "To ensure your safe passage and help the seas, you must solve the challenges 
    that lie ahead. Your first challenge awaits. Good luck, Seafaring Sleuths!" </p>
  
  <p>A new question appeared on the screen: </p>

  <p>Max quickly grabbed a pencil and paper from the desk in the corner as Mia peered over his shoulder. 
    They typed their answer into the control panel. The submarine gave a little jolt and then started to 
    move at the correct speed. They were on their way through the canyon! </p>

    <p>As they emerged from the canyon, they found themselves in a beautiful underwater garden. Tall seaweed 
      swayed with the current, and brightly colored coral dotted the landscape. But the screen lit up once 
      more with a new challenge. </p>

 <p>They entered their answer into the control panel. The submarine's lights flickered for a moment before 
  a cheerful chime confirmed they were correct. </p>

 <p> "Great job, Seafaring Sleuths!" the voice said. "You have successfully navigated the first part of your 
  journey. Prepare for the next challenge!" </p>
  
 <p> The submarine continued its journey deeper into the ocean. The friends felt a mix of excitement and
   curiosity about what lay ahead. They knew that with teamwork and a little bit of math, they could 
   handle anything the SS Curiosity threw at them.  </p>
