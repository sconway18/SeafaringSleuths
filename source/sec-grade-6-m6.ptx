      <p>The SS Curiosity moved further into the depths of the Sunken City, guided by the map they had uncovered. 
        The passageways grew narrower, and the submarine had to navigate carefully through the ancient ruins. 
        The screen lit up once more, signaling the final challenge ahead.  </p>
       
        <p> The friendly voice spoke, "You have come far, Seafaring Sleuths. To complete your journey and uncover 
            the final secret of the Sunken City, you must use your math skills one last time. Good luck!" </p>
