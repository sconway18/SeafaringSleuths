# Seafaring Sleuths

This is a repository for a series of short reading, science, and mathematics activities where students read a short story, solving math and science questions along the way, helping them solve a problem, solve a mystery, or discover treasure. The goal is to embed reading comprehension, mathematics, science, and more into one cohesive experience for students in grades 1 - 6.
