# Seafaring Sleuths

This is a repository for a series of short reading, science, and mathematics activities where students read a short mystery, solving math and science questions along the way, helping them solve the mystery. The goal is to embed reading comprehension, mathematics, science, and more into one cohesive experience for students in grades 1 - 6.
